## Set up enviroment

The easiest way to set up enviroment is to follow [this instructions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). Remember to pick _React Native CLI Quickstart_, not the one for Expo.

## Run the code

To run this code you need to install node modules

```bash
npm install
```

Then you have to run app itself

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```
